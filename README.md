# Generative AI on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

This repository showcases a Generative AI implementation using the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach. The project is divided into four main components: Data Ingestion, Data Transformation, Embeddings, and Vectorstore.

## Introduction

RAG combines the capabilities of retrieval-based systems and generative models to produce high-quality and contextually relevant responses. This project demonstrates how to implement a RAG pipeline by breaking it down into four essential stages:

1. **Data Ingestion**: Gathering and preparing the data for further processing.
2. **Data Transformation**: Cleaning, transforming, and preprocessing the ingested data.
3. **Embeddings**: Generating embeddings for the processed data to capture semantic meaning.
4. **Vectorstore**: Storing and managing the embeddings for efficient retrieval.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10
- Conda environment
